# Feature Flags for Safe Deployments

Feature flags (or feature toggles) are a powerful technique that complements any branching strategy by decoupling deployment from release. They allow teams to deploy code to production without making it immediately available to users.

### Integration with LaunchDarkly

LaunchDarkly provides a comprehensive feature flag management platform that enables teams to:

1. **Control feature rollout.** Gradually release features to subsets of users to minimize risk.
2. **A/B testing.** Test different implementations with different user segments.
3. **Kill switches.** Quickly disable problematic features without rolling back deployments.
4. **Targeted releases.** Release features to specific user segments based on attributes.
5. **Experimentation.** Measure the impact of features on key metrics before full rollout.

### Best Practices for Feature Flags

1. **Temporary vs. permanent flags.** Distinguish between flags used for rollout control (temporary) and those used for long-term configuration (permanent).
2. **Flag lifecycle management.** Establish processes for creating, using, and removing flags to prevent flag debt.
3. **Default safe values.** Ensure that if flag evaluation fails, the system defaults to a safe state.
4. **Testing with flags.** Test both flag states to ensure the system behaves correctly in all scenarios.
5. **Documentation.** Maintain clear documentation of active flags and their purpose.
